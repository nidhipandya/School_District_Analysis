# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this project was to prepare an analysis of performance trends for all standardized tests for a city school.  After analyzing the data on student funding and standardized tests, the school board can make decisions on budgets and priority of teaching.

During the analysis some data from the scores of the 9th grade at Thomas High School are not accurate data so they had to be replaced with NaN.  A report was then prepared with the updates.

## Results

Using the result images and explanation, gave the answers of the following questions.

### How is the district summary affected?
The performance of the district went down slightly, as shown in the two images. The overall percentage passing went down from 65.1% to 64.9%.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Relative to other schools, the removal of the 9th graders' data had no affect on the ranking of the school.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#### Math and reading scores by grade

## Summary: 
Changing the 9th grade reading and math scores changed a few aspects of the final data output:
* The overall district performance decreases by a slight margin.
* The school performance of Thomas High School goes down.
* Obviously the 9th grade math and reading scores are also missing in the "scores by grade" chart
* Although these scores are missing, The overall affect to the school's performance has not been affected significantly.
